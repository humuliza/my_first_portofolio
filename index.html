    <h2>More About HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create the structure of webpages and organize content in a meaningful way.</p>
    <p>With HTML, you can define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more to make your website informative and visually appealing.</p>
